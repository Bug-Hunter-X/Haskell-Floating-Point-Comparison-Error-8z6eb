The solution involves comparing floating-point numbers within a tolerance range instead of using direct equality. This accounts for the small discrepancies that can arise from floating-point representation.

```haskell
import Data.Ord (comparing)

withinTolerance :: Double -> Double -> Double -> Bool
withinTolerance x y tolerance = abs (x - y) < tolerance

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = 0.1 + 0.2
  let y = 0.3
  let tolerance = 1e-10 -- Adjust as needed
  if withinTolerance x y tolerance
    then putStrLn "x equals y within tolerance"
    else putStrLn "x does not equal y within tolerance"
```
This corrected version utilizes the `withinTolerance` function to check if the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is less than the specified `tolerance`.  Adjusting the `tolerance` value allows you to control the level of precision needed for your comparisons.
