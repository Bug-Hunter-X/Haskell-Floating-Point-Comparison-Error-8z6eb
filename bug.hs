This code suffers from a common Haskell pitfall: using `==` to compare floating-point numbers.  Floating-point numbers are inherently imprecise; due to how they're represented in binary, many decimal values cannot be perfectly expressed. Therefore, directly comparing them with `==` often yields unexpected results.  Even simple calculations can lead to minor discrepancies, causing the comparison to fail.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = 0.1 + 0.2
  let y = 0.3
  if x == y
    then putStrLn "x equals y"
    else putStrLn "x does not equal y"
```
This code will print "x does not equal y", even though mathematically, x should equal y.
